= 15 Shades of Grey =

Haskell implementations of the 15-puzzle, with grey squares instead of numbers.
Use arrow keys or the mouse to slide them so they appear from brightest to
darkest going left to right, top to bottom.

One program uses https://www.libsdl.org/[the SDL library], and the other uses
http://haste-lang.org/[the Haste compiler] to produce JavaScript.
